# PHP_Piscine_Web

For day 03 of the Piscine, we practiced PHP on a more practical level - creating programs that analyze the contents of URLs, create and store cookies, and insert content into webpages. Here's what each of my exercise submissions does.

## Ex00 : Install
Simply install bitnami MAMP!

## Ex01 : phpinfo
A file that executes and shows the result of phpinfo() on http://localhost:8080/.

## Ex02 : print_get
A file that displays all the variables passed to a url (with GET).

## Ex03 : cookie_crisp
A file that allows you to create, read, and erase a cookie.

## Ex04 : raw_text
A file that displays a code block as raw text in a browser as well as when you look at its source code
with curl. The output must be identical.

## Ex05 : read_img
A file that displays the file "42.png" in a browser with the correct Content-Type.
